![Dithered Invader album cover](/Outputs/Out-single-7-1767901641.652394.jpg)

# Use case
I created this small script in order to generate in no time album cover type of artwork for a serie of self released music. It hence give coherence and simplify the process of getting muisc released out every weeks.

# Ordered dithering and Invader generator
I've remixed the code of two existing github project I found:
- qorph's work for the dithering algo: https://github.com/qroph/ordered-dithering/
- kosachevds for the invader generator: https://github.com/kosachevds/invaders_generator

I might add features in the futur (like a setting menu in command line or a graphical interface) but for now it works well as expected.
